This code attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds.  The `myArray` only contains 2 elements, but the code tries to access index 2 (which is the third element). This leads to an out-of-bounds exception, causing a crash or unpredictable behavior.

```objectivec
NSArray *myArray = @[@1, @2];
NSInteger index = 2;
NSNumber *value = myArray[index]; // This line causes the error
NSLog (@"Value: %@
", value);
```
